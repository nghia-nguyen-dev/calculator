## Tech

-   html
-   css
-   javascript
-   React
-   Redux
-   Ramda.js

## Goals

-   Get familiar setting up redux
-   Get familiar working with redux and how it integrates with react
-   Work with a single global state management
-   Handling as much logic inside of reducers and keeping components clean for presentation

### Notes/observation

-   Updating multiple states with one action is more ideal in redux vs react components
-   Redux makes it very predictable when state changes
-   Keeping a consistent data type helps avoid issues
